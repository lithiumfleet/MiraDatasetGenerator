# MiraDatasetGenerator
> The core of Mira ~

## Intro
This is a pipeline for generating MiraDataset. The goal is to produce a set of data that can be used to: 

1. enhance Mira's tone of voice; 
2. fix Mira's persona;
3. help Mira perform better in common domains and on common tasks.

With vllm's powerful batch process and parallel generation pipeline, this generator can quickly iterate and generate data in multiple formats. 
We may try to turn this project into a generalized RP task data generator in the future.
